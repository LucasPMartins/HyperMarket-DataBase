## ‚ùî About
This project aims to reinforce students' knowledge in modeling real-world problems, applying fundamental concepts of relational algebra, SQL (both DDL and DML), stored procedures and triggers. To achieve these objectives, a database was developed for a hypermarket, using SQL, PostgreSQL and the ERD PLUS platform to create the entity-relationship model. The project is part of an academic work context, allowing students to learn in practice how to structure and manage a complex database system. The practical execution of this project aims not only to reinforce the knowledge acquired in the classroom, but also to provide an opportunity to apply these concepts to a real problem. The methodology adopted follows the guidelines of Professor Maria Camila Nardini Barioni, as presented in her classes through slides and exercise lists. The target audience of the project is the teacher, who will assess the understanding and application of the concepts covered throughout the course.
